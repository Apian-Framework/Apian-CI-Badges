# Apian-CI-Badges

This repository is a sort-of data-dump for github action CI-generated status/progress badges for the other repos.

I didn't want to have to use a 3rd-party data storage service in order to store the badge images, so I came up with this way to store them in a github repository. It's not super-pretty, and maybe isn't really such a great idea - but it seems to work.
